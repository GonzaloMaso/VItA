/**
 * This domain features three different type of volumes: (i) transport volume;
 * (ii) vascularized volumes; (iii) non-vascularized volumes. A transport volume
 * allows that existent vessels within it, create terminals to vascularized volumes.
 * Thus, its space may prone anastomose from existent arteries to vascularized regions,
 * but no terminals can be created in it. A vascularized volume allowed the anastomose
 * in its existent vessels and the creation of terminals within it. Lastly,
 * non-vascularized volumes do not allowed vessels to enter exit nor generate terminals.
 * It is mandatory that vascularized regions be within the transport volume.
